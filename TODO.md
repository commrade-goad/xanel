## NOTE

### Enemy Spawn
1. tposting guy
2. Skeleton guy
3. Racoon
4. Zombie

### Mechanic
- Every enemy will drop the currency to level up (some will drop weapon that can be used only on that run)
- 1 Level (Wave) will spawn couple of enemies with certain delay
- the more wave done the more enemy damage and healt + (so boss didnt exist)
- the more wave done the more enemy spawn too
- enemy type spawn randomly
- After 1 Level done the Levelup Window will pop up so player can upgrade + buy magic maybe
- After clearing level player will get 1 healing potion
- There will be transition if the background change (from dirt to other terrrain) (maybe portal?) (after 25 wave maybe)
- After getting a new sword the player can still use the old sword (but without the effect of the new sword)
- Dash will decrease the sp bar
- Enemy spawn level + 1, so at wave 50 it will be 51 enemy that spawned atleast max 5 spawned on arena
- A simple timer at the top for how long the game has been going
